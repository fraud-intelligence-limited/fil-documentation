# Welcome

Welcome to the *Fraud Intelligence Blockchain* (FIB) documentation.

FIB is a blockchain-based platform designed to combat fraud in various industries, including telecommunications, finance, and e-commerce.

This platform provides a secure and decentralized system for storing and sharing fraud-related information among participants to prevent potential fraudulent activities.

FIB operates on the [***Iroha 2 Hyperledger blockchain***](/#what-is-iroha-2) and uses smart contracts to automate the exchange of fraud intelligence data. This platform enables organizations to securely share and access real-time information about known fraud events and other relevant data, allowing them to identify potential fraud attempts quicker and more accurately.

## Where to start?

If you are new to FIB, start with the [***Overview***](./api_docs/Overview.md) section, which provides a high-level introduction to the technology. This section explains what the FIB is, how it works, and other related concepts and terms.

For instructions on how to get started with the FIB, check out the [***Getting Started***](./api_docs/Getting_started.md) section. This section covers everything from setting up your FIB account to accessing the API, and integrating it into your existing workflows and systems.

If you're looking for step-by-step guidance on how to interact with the FIB API, check out the [***Tutorials***](./api_docs/Tutorials.md) section where you can find a variety of scenarios to help you get started with the API.

## What is Iroha 2? {#what-is-iroha-2}

[***Iroha 2***](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/iroha2) is a blockchain hyperledger used to manage accounts, assets, and on-chain data storage with efficient smart contracts. The ledger is written in Rust and provides the following SDKs:

- [**Iroha Java/Kotlin**](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-java/tree/iroha2-main)
- [**Iroha Python**](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/tree/iroha2)
- [**Iroha Javascript**](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript/tree/iroha2)
- [**Iroha Rust**](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/iroha2-lts/client)

Check out the [***Iroha 2 Documentation***](https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-2-docs/) as it provides an introduction to Iroha 2 as well as language-specific guides for Bash, Python, Rust, Kotlin/Java, and Javascript/TypeScript.
