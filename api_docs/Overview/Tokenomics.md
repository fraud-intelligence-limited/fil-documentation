# Tokenomics

## Payment model

The FIB uses a pay-per-use model that allows users to earn and spend internal digital credits.

Credits can be spent on downloading fraud event data from other users and on purchasing a *[premium subscription](#premium-subscription)*.

## Uploading fraud events

In order to incentivize the registered peers to submit the fraud events that they have encountered, credits are rewarded for every submitted contribution.

For instructions on how to upload a fraud event—submit a contribution—see *[Submitting a contribution](/api_docs/Tutorials/Submitting_a_contribution.md)*.

## Downloading fraud events

The earned credits can be used to pay for downloading the fraud event data stored on the blockchain, which enables peers to update their own records and stay informed about the latest fraudulent activities. This process helps organizations to remain vigilant and prevent fraudulent activities from occurring within their own system.

For instructions on how to download a fraud event—retrieve a contribution—see *[Retrieving top contributions](/api_docs/Tutorials/Retrieving_top_contributions.md)*.

## Credit balance

The number of digital credits that a peer has on their account, and that can be used to pay for downloading of fraud event data.

See also *[Retrieving credit balance](/api_docs/API_Specification/wallet-controller/Retrieving_credit_balance.md)*.
