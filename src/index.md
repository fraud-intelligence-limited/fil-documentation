# Welcome

Welcome to the _Fraud Intelligence Blockchain_ (FIB) documentation.

FIB is a blockchain-based platform designed to combat fraud in various industries, including telecommunications, finance, and e-commerce.

This platform provides a secure and decentralized system for storing and sharing fraud-related information among participants to prevent potential fraudulent activities.

FIB operates on the [Iroha 2 Hyperledger blockchain](/#what-is-iroha-2) and uses smart contracts to automate the exchange of fraud intelligence data. This platform enables organizations to share securely and access real-time information about known fraud events and other relevant data, allowing them to identify potential fraud attempts quicker and more accurately.

## What is Iroha 2? {#what-is-iroha-2}

[Iroha 2](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/iroha2) is a blockchain hyperledger that manages accounts, assets, and on-chain data storage with efficient smart contracts. The ledger is written in Rust and provides the following SDKs:

- [Iroha Java/Kotlin](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-java/tree/iroha2-stable)
- [Iroha Python](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/tree/stable)
- [Iroha Javascript](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript/tree/stable)
- [Iroha Rust](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/stable/client)

Check out the [Iroha 2 Documentation](https://docs.iroha.tech/) as it provides an introduction to Iroha 2 as well as language-specific guides for [Bash](https://docs.iroha.tech/guide/get-started/bash.html), [Python](https://docs.iroha.tech/guide/get-started/python.html), [Rust](https://docs.iroha.tech/guide/get-started/rust.html), [Kotlin/Java](https://docs.iroha.tech/guide/get-started/kotlin-java.html), and [Javascript/TypeScript](https://docs.iroha.tech/guide/get-started/javascript.html).
