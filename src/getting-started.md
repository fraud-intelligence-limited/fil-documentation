# Getting started

Since FIB allows its users to interact with the network both via API and the Web App, this section provides instructions for all necessary preliminary steps, be you a Web App user or a developer aiming to integrate the FIB API into their application or system.

All users should start with the [Registering an account](getting-started/registering-an-account.md) tutorial, and then move on to the [Tutorials: Web App](tutorials-web.md) section that explains how to interact with the FIB network via [FIB Web App](overview/web-interface.md).

For users willing to interact with the FIB network via FIB API, it is advised to read the following **Getting started** topics in the order that they are presented:

1. [Registering an account](getting-started/registering-an-account.md)
2. [Checking API availability](getting-started/checking-api-availability.md)
3. [Calling API endpoints](getting-started/calling-api-endpoints.md)
4. [Public test environment](getting-started/public-test-environment.md)

In turn, to receive step-by-step guidance on how to interact with the FIB API in a variety of scenarios, check out the [Tutorials: API](./tutorials-api.md) section to help you get started with specific API operations.

For information on all available API operations, see [API Specification](api-specification.md).
