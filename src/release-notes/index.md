- When retrieving top contributions, the API response now displays additional information.

  > Documented here:\
  > [Overview > Contributions](../overview/contributions.md#api-requests-data-structure) — **API requests data structure** updated with `flagger`, `self`, `old`, `new` and `creditsSpent` fields.\
  > [API Specification > Retrieving top contributions](../api-specification/contribution-controller/retrieving-top-contributions.md) — **Output/response structure** updated.

- Contributions on the blockchain now have a `flagger` value that displays the ID of a peer that flagged the contribution if it has been flagged.

  > [Overview > Contributions](../overview/contributions.md#api-requests-data-structure) — **Flagging contributions** and **API requests data structure** updated.

- Added functionality related to the confidence index, a value between 1 and 100 that represents how confident the system is that a contributed fraud event is legitimate.

  > Documented here:\
  > [Overview > Tokenomics](../overview/tokenomics.md#confidence-index) — **Confidence Index** subtopic added.\

### Other Improvements

- Performed an audit of the interservice communication safety, fixed known security-related vulnerabilities, updated the implemented third-party dependencies.

- Indexed data on the network, enhancing the overall performance of the search engine that retrieves stored contributions.

- Refactored and optimized the code structure of the query engine that can retrieve all data of any specific type.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where leftover data with peer details remained on the network after a peer had been deleted; this caused a new peer account to be corrupted in case it was registered again with the same credentials, as well as potential issues with other peer data getting corrupted.

- Fixed a bug that allowed users to find out the subscription type of any other peer.

- Fixed a bug with call processing timeouts being inconsistent.
