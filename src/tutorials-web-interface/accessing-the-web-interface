# Log in to the FIB Web Interface

After registering, users can log in to the FIB web interface using their registered credentials. The system home page includes two tabs: Threatmap and Fraud Twitter Feed.


## Navigate to the Threatmap Tab

The Threatmap tab displays a fraud threat-map that reflects fraud data uploaded by consortium peers. Recent submissions to the ledger are dynamically presented, including the type of fraud, country of origin, and termination.

## Navigate to the Fraud Twitter Feed Tab

The Fraud Twitter Feed tab displays customer fraud-related tweets for major cities globally. Users can scroll and select countries to see what telco customers in those countries are contributing to Twitter in relation to fraud.
