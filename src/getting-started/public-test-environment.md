# Public test environment

The test environment is a safe and controlled environment where you can try out and experiment with the FIB API without affecting the production system. Here, you can make mistakes, test different scenarios, and learn how to use the API.

To access the test environment, you need to follow the same steps as for the production environment. The only difference is that you will be provided with test credentials instead of production credentials (see [Connection details](#connection-details) below).

Using the test environment is beneficial for at least the following several reasons:

- You can test your implementation without affecting the production network.
- You can catch and fix bugs before deploying to production.
- You can optimize and fine-tune performance by simulating different loads and scenarios.
