# Registering an account

To begin using FIB as a peer and accessing API endpoints, you need to register a user account.

To register an account, perform the following steps:

1. Go to the [Fraud Intelligence Blockchain website](https://blockchain.fraudintelligencelimited.com/#/Index) and select **Register** from the top right menu.
2. On the **User details for Registration** page that appears, fill in your personal and company details.
3. Agree to the [Terms & Conditions](https://github.com/fraud-intelligence-limited/fil-legal/blob/main/Fraud%20Intelligence%20Blockchain%20Terms%20of%20Use%20v4.0.pdf) by selecting the **I agree to the terms** checkbox.
4. On the **Subscription details** tab, select **Register Account**.

### Expected Result

You have now submitted your registration application which is then manually reviewed by the Consortium Administrator.

As soon as your application is approved, you receive an email notifying you that you become a peer in the FIB network and, depending on the chosen access method, you can access the FIB functionality via Web UI and/or API endpoints.

For Web UI tutorials, see [Tutorials: Web interface](../tutorials-web.md).

For API tutorials, see [Tutorials: API](../tutorials-api.md).
