# Registering an account

To begin using FIB as a peer and accessing API endpoints, you need to register a user account.

To register an account, perform the following steps:

1. Go to the [Fraud Intelligence Blockchain website](https://blockchain.fraudintelligencelimited.com/#/Index) and select **Register** from the top right menu.
2. In the **User details for Registration** window that appears, fill in your personal and company details.
3. Agree to the [Terms & Conditions](https://github.com/fraud-intelligence-limited/fil-legal/blob/main/RAG%20Fraud%20Blockchain%20Terms%20of%20Use%20v2.0.docx) by ticking the **I agree to the terms** box.
4. On the **Subscription details** tab, select **Register Account**.

### Expected Result

You have now submitted your registration application which is then manually reviewed by the Consortium Administrator.

As soon as your application is approved, you receive an email notifying you that you become a peer in the FIB network and, depending on the chosen access method, you can access the FIB functionality via UI and/or API endpoints.

## Restoring access to an account

If you have forgotten the password on your account, you can reset it by performing the following steps:

1. Go to the [Fraud Intelligence Blockchain website](https://blockchain.fraudintelligencelimited.com/#/Index) and select either **Register** or **Log in** in the top right menu.
2. On the **Register** or **Log in** page, click **Forgot password?**
3. On the **Enter email to reset password page**, enter the email address that you registered with in the provided field, then select **Reset password**.
4. Check your email inbox for a message from the FIB with instructions on how to reset your password.
5. Once you have reset your password, you can log in to your FIB account using your new password.
