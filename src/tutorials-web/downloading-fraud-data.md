### Expected result

The fraud events data, filtered according to your specified criteria, is downloaded to your device as a .csv file, which can be opened using any spreadsheet software available to you (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets); and the credit balance is decreased based on the current conversion rate active in the network (see [Current conversion rate](../overview/tokenomics.md#current-conversion-rate)).
