The fraud events data, filtered according to your specified criteria, is downloaded to your device as a `.csv` file, which can be opened using any spreadsheet software available to you (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets); and the [token balance](../overview/web-interface.md#balance) of the signed-in user is decreased based on the current conversion rate active in the network (see [Current conversion rate](../overview/tokenomics.md#current-conversion-rate)).
